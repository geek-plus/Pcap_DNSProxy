* WinPcap suggested that older versions could not be installed:
  * To install and uninstall the program, run the menu or% PROGRAMFILES (x86)% (64-bit system) /% PROGRAMFILES% (32-bit system) Find WinPcap uninstaller
  * If you can not find the uninstaller, you may need to enter the safe mode to remove all WinPcap files and then reinstall:
    *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ Packet.dll
    *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ drivers \ npf.sys
    *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ WanPacket.dll
    *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ wpcap.dll
    *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ pthreadVC.dll

* Appears when installing, running, or restarting services:
  * Service does not respond in time to start or control request - check for error report generation, see below for details Error.log Detailed Error Report section
  * Please check if there is an error report generated. For details, see the following section. Error.log Detailed Error Report Section

* Debug mode
  * When there is any suspected program is not working properly or error situation, you can bypass the service control program directly using the debug mode debug mode, all errors will be directly output to the screen
  * Terminate all running instances and determine that only one program is running at the same time
  * Windows
    * Run directly with administrator permission

* If the following results occur, the service is not running successfully or the setting error, please check whether there is an error report generated, or move the ReadMe document in the installation method section
